**Web2Markdown** is a simple Chrome extension that empowers users to effortlessly convert the current web page into a Markdown file. With just a click of a button, users can transform the content of any webpage into Markdown format and download it instantly.

**Why I built it:**

When I want to use a large language model to summarize the content of certain web pages, I often encounter situations where the language model cannot read the content of the web page. Therefore, I want to convert the web page into a Markdown file and upload it to the large language model for easy access to the web page content.
